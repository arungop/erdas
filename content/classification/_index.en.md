Classification is the process of sorting pixels into a finite number of individual classes, or categories, of data based on their data file values. If a pixel satisfies a certain set of criteria, then the pixel is assigned to the class that corresponds to those criteria. There are two ways to classify pixels into different categories **Supervised** and **Unsupervised**.
